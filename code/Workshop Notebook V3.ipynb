While this tutorial focuses on thalamocortical connectivity, the dataset contains connections between the frontal cortex and other brain regions, which have yet to be thoroughly explored. \n    \n**Dataset:**  This dataset was collected using the mesoscale anatomy platform established at the Allen Institute for Neural Dynamics. Brain samples are cleared and imaged on a SmartSPIM lightsheet microscope. Images are stitched and fused into a 3D volume and aligned to the Common Coordinate Framework (CCF), which allows for integration between samples. Candidate cell somas are algorithmically detected and then classified as true detections or non-cells using a trained deep neural network. This yields a collection of cells throughout the brain, each of which are localized within CCF space. The datasets in this tutorial have been QC'd to verify accurate cell detection, but this verification has been primarily performed in thalamus. Care should be taken to verify cell counts in other regions before drawing strong conclusions. \n    \n**Experiment:** These experiments are focused on the structure of inputs to frontal cortex. Retrograde viruses were injected across the frontal cortex, eliciting expression of nuclear-localized fluorophores in infected cells. These injections label somas at the site of virus delivery, as well as the somas of neurons with axonal projections to that location. The brains in this dataset received 1-3 injections of viruses expressing spectrally distinct fluorophores, and thus each injection is conceptualized as an independent connectivity mapping experiment. While the majority of these viral injections employed AAVrg-XFPs, other reagents were also used to address potential cellular or axonal density based tropism. The location of each injection site was empirically determined.\n        \n    \n**Goal:** This tutorial will show you how to:  \n    1. analyze connectivity across brain regions  \n    2. work with 3D volumetric microscopy data of whole mouse brains \n\n"},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"538e274b","metadata":{},"source":"<div style=\"border-left: 3px solid #000; padding: 1px; padding-left: 10px; background: #F0FAFF; \">\n\n#### Import packages and load data<br>\n    \n    "},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"id":"b1f94bd0-8928-4a05-8079-2aa84a3ac300","metadata":{"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":"# general imports \n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom IPython.core.display import HTML\n\nimport pandas as pd\n%matplotlib inline"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"id":"531bb4ba-851d-45a7-8a5e-a0eeab22b67c","metadata":{"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":"# specific imports and brain atlas initialization \n\nfrom load_data import load_data\nimport brainglobe_atlasapi as atlasapi\nfrom brainglobe_atlasapi import BrainGlobeAtlas\natlasapi.config.write_config_value('brainglobe_dir', '/data/.brainglobe') # points to allen mouse atlases pre-loaded in data folder \natlas = BrainGlobeAtlas('allen_mouse_25um', \n                        check_latest = False) # load CCF mouse brain atlas, 25um resolution "},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"46612880","metadata":{},"source":"<div style=\"border-left: 3px solid #000; padding: 1px; padding-left: 10px; background: #F0FAFF; \">\n\n#### Load data for a single brain \n      \nThe load_data object class is a wrapper for pulling relevant lightsheet data and data products from the /data folders for a given mouse ID.

The rest of this tutorial will show you how to load and analyze the spatial coordinates of these detected cells.  \n    \nThe `getCellsCCFdf` function loads the spatial coordinates of the detected cells in a given channel.
